#### You're Very Own URL Shortening Service

**Your mission**:  *Create your own â€œURL Shortener" application in PHP (similar to goo.gl)*


* A user should be able to place in a long URL and submit.

* It should store the long version of the URL, and generate a short URL for the user.

* All subsequent requests to the short URL should send the user to the long URL by some manner of redirect.

* You can use whatever frameworks you desire (Laravel, Symfony2, Slim, Codeigniter).

* You can use whatever data storage method you prefer (SQLite, MySQL, flat-file).

* You are free to build up the complexity as you desire (CRUD, analytics, caching), but try not to spend more than 1~3 hours.
